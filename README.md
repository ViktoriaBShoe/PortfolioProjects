# SQL Portfolio Projects

**1. US Car Accidents 2022**

In this project, I manipulated data in SQL to analyze trends and correlations in car accidents across the United States for the year 2022. 
Key tasks included altering tables by adding columns (casting dates), performing table joins, using CASE expressions, employing subqueries, and applying aggregate functions to extract meaningful insights.

The data for this project was sourced from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration https://www.nhtsa.gov, which provides public access to this information.

A Tableau visualization of the findings can be found at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/viktoriia.shoemaker/viz/USCarAccidents2022/Dashboard1?publish=yes.



**2. COVID Portfolio Project**

This project was developed by following Alex the Analyst's portfolio project video on SQL data exploration. 
The focus is on querying and analyzing data sets to extract meaningful insights and improve SQL proficiency. 
The project includes basic queries as well as advanced concepts such as Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, and rolling numbers.

The data used in this project was pulled from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
